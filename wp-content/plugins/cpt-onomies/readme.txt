Use your custom post types as taxonomies. Create powerful relationships between your posts and, therefore, powerful content.

== Description ==

*CPT-onomies* is a **multisite compatible** WordPress plugin that allows you to create very powerful taxonomies and, therefore, very powerful relationships between your posts.

CPT-onomies are Custom-Post-Type-powered taxonomies that function just like regular WordPress taxonomies, even allowing you to use core WordPress taxonomy functions, such as [get_terms()](http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/get_terms "get_terms()") and [wp_get_object_terms()](http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_get_object_terms "wp_get_object_terms()"). *[Check out the CPT-onomy documentation](http://wpdreamer.com/plugins/cpt-onomies/documentation "CPT-onomy documentation") to see which core WordPress taxonomy functions work and when you'll need to access the plugin's CPT-onomy functions.*

CPT-onomies includes a custom post type manager, allowing you to create custom post types and register CPT-onomies **without touching one line of code!**

**If you're running a WordPress multisite network**, you can register your custom post types/CPT-onomies across your entire network OR on a site-by-site selection. All from one screen!

*If you're already using a plugin, or theme, that creates custom post types, don't worry, CPT-onomies is all-inclusive.* **Any registered custom post type can be used as a CPT-onomy.**

= What Is A CPT-onomy? =

A CPT-onomy is a Custom-Post-Type-powered taxonomy that functions just like a regular WordPress taxonomy, using your post titles as your taxonomy terms. "Attach", or register, your CPT-onomy to any post type and create relationships between your posts, just as you would create taxonomy relationships. Need to associate a CPT-onomy term with its post? No problem! **The CPT-onomy term's term ID is the same as the post ID.**

= Is CPT-onomy An Official WordPress Term? =

No. It's just a fun word I made up.

= Need Custom Post Types But Not (Necessarily) CPT-onomies? =

CPT-onomies offers an extensive, **and multisite compatible**, custom post type manager, allowing you to create and completely customize your custom post types within the admin.

= Why CPT-onomies? =

It doesn't take long to figure out that custom post types can be a pretty powerful tool for creating and managing numerous types of content. For example, you might use the custom post types "Movies" and "Actors" to build a movie database but what if you wanted to group your "movies" by its "actors"? You could create a custom "actors" taxonomy but then you would have to manage your list of actors in two places: your "actors" custom post type and your "actors" taxonomy. This can be a pretty big hassle, especially if you have an extensive custom post type.

**This is where CPT-onomies steps in.** Register your custom post type, 'Actors', as a CPT-onomy and CPT-onomies will build your 'actors' taxonomy for you, using your actors' post titles as the terms. Pretty cool, huh?

= Using CPT-onomies =

What's really great about CPT-onomies is that they function just like any other taxonomy, allowing you to use WordPress taxonomy functions, like [get_terms()](http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/get_terms "get_terms()"), [get_the_terms()](http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/get_the_terms "get_the_terms()") and [wp_get_object_terms()](http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_get_object_terms "wp_get_object_terms()"), to access the CPT-onomy information you need. CPT-onomies will also work with tax queries when using [The Loop](http://wpdreamer.com/plugins/cpt-onomies/documentation/The_Loop/ "The WordPress Loop"), help you build [custom CPT-onomy archive pages](http://wpdreamer.com/plugins/cpt-onomies/documentation/custom-archive-pages/ "Custom CPT-onomy Archive Pages"), allow you to [programmatically register your CPT-onomies](http://wpdreamer.com/plugins/cpt-onomies/documentation/register_cpt_onomy/), and includes a tag cloud widget for your sidebar. [Check out the CPT-onomies documentation](http://wpdreamer.com/plugins/cpt-onomies/documentation/ "CPT-onomies Documentation") for more information.

If you're not sure what a taxonomy is, how to use one, or if it's right for your needs, be sure to do some research. [The WordPress Codex page for taxonomies](http://codex.wordpress.org/Taxonomies) is a great place to start!

***Note:** Unfortunately, not every taxonomy function can be used at this time. [Check out the CPT-onomy documentation](http://wpdreamer.com/plugins/cpt-onomies/documentation "CPT-onomy documentation") to see which WordPress taxonomy functions work and when you'll need to access the plugin's CPT-onomy functions.*

== Installation ==

1. Upload 'cpt-onomies' to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Go to *Settings > CPT-onomies*
1. Create a new custom post type or edit an existing custom post type
1. Register your custom post type as a CPT-onomy by "attaching" it to a post type, under "Register this Custom Post Type as a CPT-onomy" on the edit screen
1. Use your CPT-onomy just like any other taxonomy (refer to the [CPT-onomy documentation](http://wpdreamer.com/plugins/cpt-onomies/documentation "CPT-onomy documentation") for help)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why does CPT-onomies not work with all of the WordPress taxonomy functions? =

Good question. While CPT-onomies strives to mimic taxonomy functionality as much as possible, CPT-onomies are not stored in the database in the same manner as taxonomies. The simplest answer to "Why not?" is that I believe my current method of *"not duplicating post information to resave as taxonomy information"* is in the best all-around interest of not only my plugin, but also your web site. With that said, I am constantly searching for new ways to "hook" into WordPress to improve CPT-onomy/taxonomy integration and, when impossible, will [continue to provide workarounds](http://wpdreamer.com/plugins/cpt-onomies/documentation/ "CPT-onomies Documentation").

= How do I associate a CPT-onomy term with it's matching post? =

Another good question, with a very simple answer: the term ID. CPT-onomies return the same information as taxonomies, including a term ID. A CPT-onomy term's term ID is the same as its post's post ID.

= I'm not able to save my custom post type because the page keeps telling me "That post type name already exists." =

This is a jQuery "bug" that only seems to plague a few. I've noticed that this validation standstill will occur if you have any text printed outside the `<body>` element on your page. If that's not the case, and the problem still lingers after you've upgraded to version 1.1, you can dequeue the validation script by placing the following code in your functions.php file:

`<?php
add_action( 'admin_head', 'my_website_admin_head' );
function my_website_admin_head() {
	wp_dequeue_script( 'custom-post-type-onomies-admin-options-validate' );
}
?>`

= When assigning my CPT-onomy terms, I see a checklist but I would like to use the autocomplete box (or a select dropdown). =

***As of version 1.3, you can change the format for your meta boxes via the settings page!*** The following filter still works, though, so feel free to use as you please. It will overwrite the settings.

If you have a hierarchical CPT-onomy, the default selection format is a checklist. But if you would rather use the autocomplete box, or a select dropdown, CPT-onomies allows you to hook into the meta box (via a filter) and overwrite the default selection format.

Here's an example of the filter. More information, check out the "Help" tab in the CPT-onomies settings or [visit the FAQ ](http://wordpress.org/plugins/cpt-onomies/faq/ "visit the FAQ").

`<?php
add_filter( 'custom_post_type_onomies_meta_box_format', 'my_website_custom_post_type_onomies_meta_box_format', 1, 3 );
function my_website_custom_post_type_onomies_meta_box_format( $format, $taxonomy, $post_type ) {
   // when editing a post with the post type 'movies',
   // we want to assign the 'actors' CPT-onomy terms with an autocomplete box
   if ( $post_type == 'movies' && $taxonomy == 'actors' )
      return 'autocomplete';
   // no matter the post type, we want to assign the 'actors' CPT-onomy terms with a select dropdown
   elseif ( $taxonomy == 'actors' )
      return 'dropdown';
   // no matter the post type, we want to assign the 'directors' CPT-onomy terms with a checklist
   elseif ( $taxonomy == 'directors' )
      return 'checklist';
   // WordPress filters must always return a value
   return $format;
}
?>`

= I added support for "Thumbnail" to my custom post type, but the "Featured Image" box does not show up =

You also have to add theme support for post thumbnails to your functions.php file:

`<?php add_theme_support( 'post-thumbnails' ); ?>`

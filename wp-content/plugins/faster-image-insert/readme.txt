Fully integrates media manager into editing interface, avoid reloading thickbox pop-up, with enhanced features like multi-insert & mass-editing.

== Description ==

Faster Image Insert aims to do **one thing right**:

Moves built-in Media Manager down in a meta-box, right next to main editing panel, so you have full control of the manager: opens it, makes it collapse or hidden from the interface completely.

Best of all, is now you can insert image(s) much **faster**, and **precisely** where you want them to be.

- **No thickbox**, using metabox with zero interface blocking, quite similar to the uploader in WordPress 1.5
- **No hacking**, default upload interface is not affected, only enhanced.
- **Insert multiple images** in gallery & library mode, without using shortcode; can also insert images in reversed order, and even control spacing between images.
- **Mass info editing**, change title/captions in one-shot.
- **Smart switches**: set default uploader, disable captions.

**This plugin is designed for**:

* Screenshot lover - movie, game or anime review etc.
* Howto guru - cooking guide, hardware DIY guide etc.
* Photo logger - author can comment below each photo.
* Blogger that has been shouting "run, thickbox, RUN!" to the loading screens.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does the media manager behaves the same in meta-box ? =

Yes, except less annoying (I hope).

= Why my items' ordering are not saved ? =

Remember to press "save all changes" button after re-ordering images. "Insert selected images" only outputs in listing order, NOT by ordering numbers.

= Why are blank spaces/lines not saved ? =

WordPress' default editor TinyMCE strips consecutive blank spaces/lines; the action is performed when saving or switching edit mode. This plugin tries to work around it by sending

      <p>&nbsp;</p>


= Conflicts with other plugins ? =

Following plugins are known to either modify the way data is sent to editor, or use a non-default gallery view; with these plugins you may not be able to insert multiple images at once or using our mass editing feature; other FII functions should continue to work.
